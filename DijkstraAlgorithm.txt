Function Documentation:

Struct Edge:
Purpose: Represents a graph edge.
Members: int src, int dest, int weight.

Class Graph:
Purpose: Represents a graph with methods to add edges and find shortest paths.
Data Members: int V (number of vertices), vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj (adjacency list).
Member Functions:
Graph(int V):
Purpose: Initializes the graph with V vertices.
Parameters: int V - Number of vertices.
void addEdge(int u, int v, int w):
Purpose: Adds an undirected edge between vertices u and v with weight w.
Parameters: int u, int v, int w.
void dijkstra(int src):
Purpose: Computes and prints shortest paths from vertex src to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Parameters: int src.

Driver Program (int main()):
Purpose: Tests the Graph class methods.
Steps:
Creates a graph with 9 vertices.
Adds edges to the graph.
Computes and prints shortest paths from vertex 0.
